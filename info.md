## Course Info

Welcome to CS 288: Natural Language Processing!  Our field has been changing rapidly, and this offering of the course is designed to bring recent advances into greater focus. This course will provide students with an overview of NLP, surveying core linguistic phenomena, classical statistical learning to NLP, and recent advances such as GPT-3 and Codex.

CS 288 assumes a good background in basic machine learning and a strong ability to program in Python. Prior experience with linguistics or natural languages is helpful, but not required.  There will be a lot of statistics, algorithms, and coding in this class. The recommended background is A-level mastery of CS 188/9 (or CS 281A) and CS 170 (or CS 270) as well as programming on the level of upper-division CS project courses. Note: this course will be more work-intensive than most graduate or undergraduate courses.
